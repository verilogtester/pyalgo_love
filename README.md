parse and extract strobe points
here the list of strobes present in a file, 
- first created the regular expression for the strobe points
- parse the input file and checked for the stobe points and collected in a dictionary 
- printing the dictionary elements 
- seperate functions are written for each functionality. 
this code is modular and managable, as a user, you need to change the regular expresion at one location and other code remains the same
